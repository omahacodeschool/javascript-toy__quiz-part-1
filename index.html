(This phase could easily have 20+ commits, if you're committing responsibly.)

### Instructions

First, update **index.html** by creating HTML elements that will contain the information that was previously displayed using prompts and alerts.

- `div#quiz` (This means make a `div` and give it an `id` of `quiz`.)
  - `div#question`
    - Empty for now. We'll use JavaScript to put question text into this.
  - `div#choices`
    - Empty for now. We'll use JavaScript to put question text into this.
  - `input[type=text]#answer` (This means make an `input` tag with attribute `type=text` and an `id` of `answer`.
  - `button#submitter` (This means make a `button` tag with an `id` of `submitter`.)
- `div#question_result`
  - Empty for now. We'll use JavaScript to put each question's result into this.
- `button#next`
  - This will eventually be the button that the user clicks after they see that a question was correct/wrong. It will load up the next question.
- `div#total_result`
  - Empty for now. We'll use JavaScript to put the quiz's final result into this.
