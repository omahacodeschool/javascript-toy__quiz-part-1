use JavaScript to read/interact with those HTML elements (a.k.a. the "DOM").

(This phase could easily have 20+ commits, if you're committing responsibly.)

### Instructions

Now, modify your JavaScript so that when the page loads, the first question's content is added into `div#question`. And do the same thing for the question's choices (into `div#choices`).

If it makes things easier, you can comment out large portions of **global.js**, as much of that code will be changing and/or be moved around.

Continue to add functionality that uses the elements on the page instead of prompts/alerts to conduct the quiz game:

- The user should type their answer for a question into `input[type=text]#answer`
- They should click `button#submitter` to submit that answer
- Whether they got the question correct/incorrect should be displayed in `div#question_result`
- Clicking `button#next` should replace the question and choices content with the next question. (It should also clear the user's answer to the previous question from the text field.)
- When the game is complete, the final quiz result information should be displayed in `div#total_result`

If you have trouble with this, consider taking a couple steps back and implementing the game with _just one question_ first. Don't worry about the functionality for `button#next` or even for `div#total_result` at all. Often, when a series of steps stumps us, it's best to focus in on just one step and then only zoom back out to the series after we succeed.
